    overview: "This project involved creating a series of motion graphics for a leading creative agency's brand campaign. The goal was to bring their static brand identity to life through dynamic, engaging animations that would resonate with their target audience across digital platforms.",
    problem: "The client's existing brand materials were purely static, limiting their ability to engage audiences on social media and video platforms. They needed a way to communicate their brand values through motion without losing their established visual identity.",
    solution: "I developed a comprehensive motion design system that extended their brand guidelines into the realm of animation. This included defining timing curves, transition styles, and animated logo treatments that maintained brand consistency while adding dynamic energy.",
    challenges: [
      "Maintaining brand consistency across different animation styles",
      "Optimizing file sizes for web without sacrificing quality",
      "Creating templates that could be easily adapted for various platforms",
      "Balancing creative expression with brand guidelines"
    ],
    results: [
      "40% increase in social media engagement",
      "Brand recognition improved by 25%",
      "Reduced content production time by 50%",

    overview: "This documentary project required careful editing to weave together interviews, archival footage, and original cinematography into a cohesive narrative. The film explores themes of resilience and human connection.",
    problem: "The raw footage included over 100 hours of material with multiple storylines that needed to be consolidated into a 90-minute feature. The challenge was finding the emotional through-line that would keep audiences engaged.",
    solution: "I implemented a paper edit process followed by iterative rough cuts, working closely with the director to identify the most compelling moments. The final edit uses a non-linear structure that mirrors the subject's journey.",
